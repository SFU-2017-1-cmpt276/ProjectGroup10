# ACTIVE SFU: CMPT276 Group 10

Version 3.0.

ACTIVE SFU strives to assist in the creation of a healthy campus community where users can build connections and maintain a healthy lifestyle - together. 

## How to run

Ensure that you have Xcode 8.2, Swift 3, and CocoaPods. Navigate to ACTIVESFU.xcworkspace and open it in XCode. If you don't have CocoaPods installed, run: 

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
``` 

If you have problems installing CocoaPods, check [here](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/troubleshooting#installing-cocoapods) for solutions.  

Please note that you must open ACTIVESFU.xcworkspace, not ACTIVESFU.xcodeproj, due to a CocoaPods dependency.
